# Matan's Website

## Web application I developed using Vue.js Framework, Firebase functions and Firebase hosting

The app is actually my landing page where I present my resume and the projects I have worked on over the years.

I developed the site using Vue.js.
All design on the site was built from scratch with no external library. (Using SCSS)
In addition, I use one Firebase function with which the user can send me an email.
